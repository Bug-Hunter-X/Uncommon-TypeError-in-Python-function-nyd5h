This repository demonstrates a subtle TypeError that can occur in Python when performing division. The function `function_with_uncommon_error` is designed to handle `ZeroDivisionError`, but it lacks comprehensive error handling for situations where the inputs are of incompatible types leading to a `TypeError`. The solution showcases how to improve error handling to gracefully manage this specific exception.
